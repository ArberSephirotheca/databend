- cache data crc
- metrics
- performance evaluation
    - without threshold
    - just put bytes to disk (no sync)
    - what happens if cache is full? will performance degrade significantly?
- if performance do not meet requirement
    - consider make it tiered
     - a in-memory moka at front
     - disk cache layer listen to the eviction event (serving in dedicate thread pool)
- misc: restart maybe slow if cached a large amount of data, consider make the startup of data cache layer async
        silently drop cache admissions during starting up
